The first module for processing and printing statistics from a pcap file is run
using `./sniffer <pcap>`. It opens and loops through the pcap file skipping over
packets that are not ethernet packets, then checks the IP headers of those
packets in order to check if they are TCP, UDP or other IP protocol packets.

The second module for searching the pcap file is run using `./sniffer <pcap>
search <pattern>`. It opens and loops through the pcap file, skipping over
packets that are not ethernet packets, then checks to see if data in the packet
matches the provided hex string pattern using `memmem`.

The third module for locating TCP flows using SSL/TLS is run using `./sniffer
<pcap> flows`. It opens and loops through the pcap file, skipping over any
packets that are not TCP packets, then checks to see if they contain an SSL/TLS
connection using `memmem`.
