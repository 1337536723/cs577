Setup:
------
First I had to add `/opt/android-sdk/tools/` to my PATH (this is the location of
the android sdk tools. Then I had to run `sudo android` to update the android
sdk targets. I also had to create an android virtual device using the GUI
provided by `android avd`. I created a keystore in the directory
`Keystore/testkeystore` using `keytool -genkeypair -keystore
Keystore/testkeystore -alias test` with password 'password'.

Part 1:
-------
Part 1 is in the directory `HelloWorld/`. Here I setup an android project by
running: `android create project -n HelloWorld -a MainActivity --target 1 -p .
--package com.example.HelloWorld`. I ran `ant help` to see the build targets and
then ran `ant debug` to compile the code. I ran `ant debug install` to
install the app on the android virtual device. The app can then be run from the
android virtual device.

Part 2:
-------
Part 2 is in the directory `HelloWorldModified/`. I started by coping
HelloWorld-debug.apk into the directory. Fist I needed to run `apktool if
framework-res.apk` to install the framework for running apktool then I could
run `apktool d HelloWorld-debug.apk` in order to decompile the apk to get the
resources and Manifest. I also ran `d2j-dex2jar HelloWorld-debug.apk` which
produced a jar file, this I opened with `jd-gui` in order to decompile it to
java sources. After doing modifications I rebuilt the apk using `apktool b
HelloWorld-debug` and signed the apk with `jarsigner -keystore
../../../Keystore/testkeystore HelloWorld-debug.apk test`. I was then able to
install and run it on the android virtual device using `adb install
HelloWorld-debug.apk`.

Part 3:
-------
Part 3 is in the directory `ModifiedApp/`.
