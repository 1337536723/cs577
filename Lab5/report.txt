I created two shared libraries: `libprotect.so` and `liboverride.so`. The first
is created so that those writing a new project can link against it and have
access to protected versions of the 5 functions: malloc, free, calloc, realloc
and memalign. The second library is created and linked against the first so that
it overrides the glibc versions of malloc, free, calloc, realloc and memalign so
that they call the versions in `libprotect.so`.
