Setup:
------
After installing all necessary tools I had to add `/opt/android-sdk/tools/` to
my PATH (this is the location of the android sdk tools. Then I had to run `sudo
android` to update the android sdk targets. I also had to create an android
virtual device using the GUI provided by `android avd`. I created a keystore in
the directory `Keystore/testkeystore` using `keytool -genkeypair -keystore
Keystore/testkeystore -alias test` with password 'password'.

Part 1:
-------
Part 1 is in the directory `HelloWorld/`. Here I setup an android project by
running: `android create project -n HelloWorld -a MainActivity --target 1 -p .
--package com.example.HelloWorld`. I ran `ant help` to see the build targets and
then ran `ant debug` to compile the code. I ran `ant debug install` to
install the app on the android virtual device. The app can then be run from the
android virtual device.

tl;dr
-----
apk is at: `HelloWorld/bin/HelloWorld-debug.apk`

Part 2:
-------
Part 2 is in the directory `HelloWorldModified/`. I started by coping
HelloWorld-debug.apk into the directory. Fist I needed to run `apktool if
framework-res.apk` to install the framework for running apktool then I could
run `apktool d HelloWorld-debug.apk` in order to decompile the apk to get the
resources and Manifest. I also ran `d2j-dex2jar HelloWorld-debug.apk` which
produced a jar file, this I opened with `jd-gui` in order to decompile it to
java sources. After doing modifications I rebuilt the apk using `apktool b
HelloWorld-debug` which created a new apk in
`HelloWorldModified/HelloWorld-debug/dist/` and signed the apk with `jarsigner
-keystore ../../../Keystore/testkeystore HelloWorld-debug.apk test`.  I was then
able to install and run it on the android virtual device using `adb install
HelloWorld-debug.apk`.

tl;dr
-----
Original apk is at:
`HelloWorldModified/HelloWorld-debug.apk`
Modified apk is at:
`HelloWorldModified/HelloWorld-debug/dist/HelloWorld-debug.apk`

Part 3:
-------
Part 3 is in the directory `ModifiedApp/`. I downloaded an app called 'Dicer'
from f-droid. The process was basically the same as that for part 2, so I won't
waste time detailing it. I removed the ability to roll two dice in the app and I
made it so the app only rolls the number 6.  I was able to modify permissions, I
added multiple permissions (one of which being the "Camera" permission) by
adding a line to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

tl;dr
-----
Original apk is at:
`ModifiedApp/com.platypus.dicer_4.apk`
Modified apk is at:
`ModifiedApp/com.platypus.dicer_4/dist/com.platypus.dicer_4.apk`
