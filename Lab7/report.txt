Setup:
------
First I had to add `/opt/android-sdk/tools/` to my PATH (this is the location of
the android sdk tools. Then I had to run `sudo android` to update the android
sdk targets. I also had to create an android virtual device using the GUI
provided by `android avd`.

Part 1:
-------
Part 1 is in the directory `HelloWorld/`. Here I setup an android project by
running: `android create project -n HelloWorld -a MainActivity --target 1 -p .
--package com.example.HelloWorld`. I ran `ant help` to see the build targets and
then ran `ant debug` to compile the code. I ran `ant debug install` to
install the app on the android virtual device. The app can then be run from the
android virtual device.

Part 2:
-------
Part 2 is in the directory `HelloWorldModified/`. I started by coping
HelloWorld-debug.apk into the directory.

Part 3:
-------
Part 3 is in the directory `ModifiedApp/`.
