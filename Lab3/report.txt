While working on the two exploits for this lab I had to create two separate
`exploit.c` files (one for the stack overflow and one for the heap overflow).
I also created one `hello.S` assembly shellcode that prints "Hello, World".

The purpose the `exploit.c` files serve is to print a string to give to the
vulnerable programs, these programs can be redirected to files for easy testing.
When developing each of them I used a trial and error approach to find the right
length to inject a return address at. To find the proper return address I used
gdb and disassembled vulnerable methods to get the value of the rbp and
then subtracted the length of the buffer to find the address of the beginning of
the buffer (these can be found in the `notes` files which I have included).
