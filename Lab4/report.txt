While working on this lab I created separate `exploit.c` files for each attack.
These C programs just generate strings that can be piped into `stack_overflow`
in order to exploit it.

For attack 1 I used trial and error increasing string length until I correctly
overflowed the saved eip (return address). Then disassembling the program in
gdb to find the address of the `unbelievable` function and placing this in the
return address.

For attack 2 I first set out to use the `printf` system call but had trouble
passing it arguments and getting it to work properly, so I moved to using the
`puts` function instead (which it appears `printf` with only a string literal
compiles into) and had no problems using this. For this I disassembled the program
and printed addresses of the symbols `printf` and `puts`.

For attack 3 I used the same core exploit string as attack 2 but merely replaced
some spacing characters with the address of the `exit` function.
